----- Calculate job schedules naively ----- 

This program is designed to generate a very naive schedule of jobs. It does this by taking each job in a given batch and simply scheduling it at the 
very first possible instance. In other words, it schedules each job at the job's start time. The purpose of this algorithm is to compare its results
to those of the more efficient / specialized ones such as the ILP and relaxed LP
