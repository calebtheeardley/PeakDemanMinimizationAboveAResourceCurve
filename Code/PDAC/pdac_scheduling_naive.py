* generate_jobs -> This function takes in a random sample of jobs and returns a list of job objects. This function also selects

* 
* INPUTS
*   jobs_array (List) -> an unsorted list of all of the jobs available to the user
*   start_time (int) -> The time after which all jobs must start
*   end_time (int) -> The time by which all jobs must end
*   max_length (int) -> The maximum duration of a given job
*   batch_size (int) -> The size of the batch
* 
* ADDITIONAL
* This function will select the jobs based on the parameters. However, it should not select different jobs than other algorithms becuase they will all
* be provided with the same jobs_array list and parameters
