----- Calculate Job Power Schedules with LP, Naive and Greedy Algorithms-----

This program is designed to take in n number of distinct power scheduling jobs and determine their ideal ordering in to minimize 
the peak amount of power demand above a provided resource curve.
This is a relaxed ILP problem. Therefore, it uses typical LP to solve the problem in polynomial time and then probability to estimate 
the optimal schedule of jobs.
